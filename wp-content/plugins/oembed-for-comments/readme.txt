== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### What is oEmbed ####

[oEmbed](http://www.oembed.com/) is a simple API that allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource.  It was designed to avoid copying and pasting HTML from the media you wish to embed.


#### What is oEmbed for Comments? ####

oEmbed for Comments utilizes [Wordpress' own oEmbed class](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds), so by default, you can share content from the following sites in your comments:

* YouTube
* Blip.tv
* Vimeo
* DailyMotion
* Flickr
* Hulu
* Viddler
* Qik
* Revision3
* Photobucket
* Scribd
* Wordpress.tv

The plugin allows you to input **any** URL from one of the listed sites above into a comment.

When the comment is posted and approved, the URL automagically transforms into the embedded content.  There is no GUI.


#### How do I extend Wordpress' oEmbed provider list? ####

By default, you can only embed content from websites listed on Wordpress' internal whitelist. This is to prevent the embedding of malicious content from untrustworthy websites.

To add an oEmbed provider, read the following article for more info:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds#Adding_Support_For_An_oEmbed-Enabled_Site

The other option is you can override Wordpress' internal whitelist and enable *any* site that is oEmbeddable by downloading and activating Viper007Bond's Enable oEmbed Discovery plugin.
**You should only activate the oEmbed Discovery plugin if you trust your user base. You've been warned.**


== Blacklist feature ==

This feature allows you to blacklist websites from being processed by oEmbed.

For example, say I wanted to block YouTube links from being embedded.

Open `oembed-config.php` in a text editor and add the following line to the end:

`$oembed_comments['blacklist'][] = 'youtube.com';`

This will blacklist all links from YouTube.com from being parsed.

== Known issues ==

* Hyperlinking an oEmbeddable link and inputting the same link in plain text will show the oEmbeddable item three times (two times if using anchor text) (not many people will do this)
